Homework<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Homework should be submitted
electronically to Canvas.&nbsp; You need to upload ONE PDF file with
your solution directly to Canvas.&nbsp; If you cannot prepare a typeset version, you may scan a handwritten
solution. Make sure the file is not larger than 5MB. Caution: cellphone
images are rarely readable and usually too large, and are not
acceptable. Note that graduate students (561) are required to type
their homework. Typing is slower, but it forces you to check your work
often, resulting in fewer mistakes. <br>
<br>
Homework which is illegible or otherwise incomprehensible may not
receive credit.&nbsp; Correct answers alone are insufficient for full
credit.&nbsp; A clear and coherent derivation showing all work must be
included.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answers should be worked out in advance on scrap
paper, and then written up nicely to be turned in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am
well aware that answers may be available from various sources; turning
in answers which you simply copy from another source is considered
cheating and treated accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
LaTeX:<br>
<br>
A very good way to type math is to use LaTeX, but there is a learning
curve associated with it. If you are willing to try I can help you
start the learning process. Install MikTex under Windows, MacTex on
Mac. MacTex already has a nice TexShop editor, under Windows you can
install TexnicCenter. There are many online LaTeX manuals, in
particular: <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX</a>.<br>
<br>
Homework with be posted before Thursday at 5pm and will be due the following Friday by 5 pm, unless specifically noted.<br>
<br>

Learning Environment<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The University of Oregon strives for
inclusive learning environments.&nbsp; Please notify me if the
instruction or design of this course results in disability-related
barriers to your participation. You are also encouraged to contact the
Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or <a href="mailto:uoaec@uoregon.edu">uoaec@uoregon.edu</a>.<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
Academic Conduct<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The code of student conduct and community standards is at <a href="http://conduct.uoregon.edu" target="_blank">conduct.uoregon.edu</a>.&nbsp;
In this course, it is appropriate to help each other on homework as
long as the work you are submitting is your own and you understand
it.&nbsp; It is not appropriate to help each other on exams, to look at
other students exams, or to bring unauthorized material to exams.<br>
</div>
<br>
Email<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Because I have a filter set on my
incoming email, email will only be received if it conforms to the
following guidelines.&nbsp; I will make an effort to return email which
satisfies these requirements within 24 hours.&nbsp; I will not respond
to queries about material covered during missed classes; please consult
another student for notes covering any material presented during your
absence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Email not conforming to the format below will not
recieve a response.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ul>
  <li>It must come from your official uoregon.edu email address</li>
  <li>Title line must say MATH 461</li>
  <li>Your email must open as follows, where you replace <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;&lt;your name&gt;&gt;</span> with your name as it appears with the UO registrar:<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Dear Professor Levin,<br>
I am &lt;&lt;your name&gt;&gt; enrolled in Math 461.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
Final Exam<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The following is University policy concerning final exams:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Final
examinations must be given during the scheduled final examination
period. Faculty legislation prohibits the early administration of final
examinations. Final examination week is considered to be a part of the
regular term, and to end the term prior to its scheduled date reduces
instructional days to which students are entitled.</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span>Therefore, requests to take the final at a time different from the scheduled time will not be granted.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span></div>
<br>
Class Participation<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Class attendance and participation is mandatory.&nbsp; Class participation accounts for 2% of the final grade.<br>
<br>
</div>
<br>
Class policies:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Computers, phones, tablets or other electronic devices are not permitted in class.</li>
  <li>Arrive before class begins and exit only after class is
dismissed.&nbsp; It is distracting to have students entering and
exiting, so plan accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you cannot attend for the
full length of the class,&nbsp; do not come at all. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The lowest two homework scores will be dropped.&nbsp; Late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>Requests to take scheduled exams at other times will not be granted.</li>
  <li>Do not email the instructor to ask about: material covered in
class, exam dates, requests to move exams or extensions on homework.&nbsp; Such email will not be answered.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for any annoucements, such as changes to due dates, which are made on Canvas.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
