		\question[12] Let $\zeta (r) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^{r}}$. Let $X$ be a random variable with the probability mass function
			$$
				p(k) = \begin{cases}\frac{1}{\zeta (4)} \frac{1}{k^{4}} & k=1,2,\dots \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
			$$
			Below you may express your answers in terms of the values of $\zeta$.
			\begin{parts}
				\part Find $E(X)$
				\part Find Var$(X)$.
				\part Find $E(\frac{1}{X})$.

				\item[] \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	 				\item[•] the probability of rain tomorrow, given that it rains today, equals 0.8,
					\item[•] the probability of rain tomorrow, given that it does not rain today, equals 0.5, and
					\item[•] the probability of rain today is 0.4.

		\question[5] Suppose a disease occurs with probability 0.01 in people with genotype $A$, and occurs with probability 0.10 in people with genotype $B$. The disease does not occur in people with genotype not $A$ or not $B$. The frequency of genotype $A$ is the population is 0.70, and the frequency of genotype $B$ is 0.20. A person is selected at random from the population. Given that this person has the disease, what is the probability that they are of genotype $B$?

		\question[4] \
			\begin{parts}
				\part Suppose 10 balls are thrown at a target. Each ball has chance 0.2 of hitting the target, and distinct throws are independent of one another. Find the probability that there are exactly 3 balls that hit the target.
				
				\part  Suppose that balls are thrown at the target until a ball hits the target. Find the probability that it will take 3 throws before the target is hit.
